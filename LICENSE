The main software is under the MIT license as described below.
csvgraph is loosely based on an original public domain graphing library written in Borland builder C++ 5 by Frank Heinrich, mail@frank-heinrich.de but there is very little original code left.
It also uses FFT code from KISS FFT - https://github.com/mborgerding/kissfft which was written by Mark Borgerding. Only very minor changes have been made to this code to make it compile cleanly. 
KISS FFT is covered by the BSD-3-Clause license.
