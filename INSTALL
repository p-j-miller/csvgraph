Cvsgraph is a portable program which does not need installation.
Copy the file csvgraph.exe to any location on your computer (or run it from a USB-stick or similar).
A shortcut on your desktop makes it simple to execute csvgraph.
See the file LICENSE for details but csvgraph is free for both commercial and non-commercial use.

csvgraph.exe runs on Windows (10 32 or 64 bit - it will possibly run on earlier versions of Windows back to Vista but this is untested) as it does not require any installation.
It will probably also run on Linux under Wine, but this is also untested on recent versions of csvgraph.


The source code was compiled with EmbarcaderoÂ® C++Builder 10.2 - a suitable project file is included in the archive. It should compile with no errors or warnings.
It should be easy to move to a more recent version of C++Builder (at least for a 32 bit Windows target), but equally it would not be very hard to revert to earlier versions (back to Builder C++ V5) if necessary. 

Many parts of the source code could be of interest if you don't use C++Builder - for example atof.c is part of ya-sprintf see https://github.com/p-j-miller/ya-sprintf
expr-code.cpp contains many routines that are generally useful (and most of this file is pure C) - including a fast general expression evaluator for expressions stored in strings.
UScientificGraph.cpp contains an efficient median filter implementation and a polynomial fit implementation both of which work well with a very large number of data points and the implementations for these are believed to be novel. 
It also contains a fast line clipping algorithm that allows "infinite" zoom in/out.
